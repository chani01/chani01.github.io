# Probe

An easy-to-use and powerful Android logging library with a fluent tag API.
Probe helps you write clean, readable logs with support for trace logging,
JSON formatting, and optional file persistence.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Simple API**: Minimal setup with intuitive method calls.
- **Default Tag Support**: Set a global default tag for all logs.
- **Fluent Tag API**: Chain custom tags using `tag()` for clean and readable logging.
- **Log Levels**: Supports `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `TRACE`.
- **JSON Logging**: Pretty-print JSON strings or objects for better readability.
- **File Logging**: Optionally persist logs to a file for debugging.
- **Flexible Logging Control**: Enable or disable logging dynamically using `isLoggingEnabled`.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Add JitPack repository

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

### 2. Add dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.chani01:Probe:<latest_version>"
}
```

Sync your project after adding the dependency.

## 📖 Usage

### Initialization

Initialize `Probe` in your `Application` class or any entry point:

```kotlin
Probe.init(
    tag = "MyAppTag",
    isLoggingEnabled = BuildConfig.DEBUG,
    logFile = null // optional
)
```

#### Parameters
- **`defaultTag`**: Default tag used when no custom tag is provided.
- **`isLoggingEnabled`**: Enables or disables logging dynamically.
- **`logFile`**: (Optional) File where logs will be written.  
  If `null`, file logging is disabled.

> **Note:** `init()` is designed to be called once. Subsequent calls are ignored and a warning is logged.

---

### Basic Logging

```kotlin
Probe.d("This is a debug message")
Probe.i("This is an info message")
Probe.w("This is a warning")
Probe.e("This is an error message")
Probe.t("This is a trace log")
```

---

### Custom Tag Logging

Use the fluent `tag()` API to override the default tag per log:

```kotlin
Probe.tag("MainActivity").d("Activity started")
Probe.tag("Network").e("API request failed")
```

If no tag is specified, the default tag is used.

---

### Trace Logging

Probe provides call stack–based trace logging.
TRACE logs capture the execution path of your code by extracting
user-level call stacks while filtering out framework and internal calls.

This is especially useful for debugging complex flows
and hard-to-reproduce issues.

```kotlin
Probe.t("Enter MainActivity")
Probe.tag("Repository").t("Fetching data")
```

---

### JSON Logging

Probe supports logging JSON content in a readable, pretty-printed format.

```kotlin
val jsonString = """
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Probe",
  "enabled": true
}
"""

Probe.json(jsonString)
Probe.tag("API").json(jsonString, Log.WARN)
```

JSON output is automatically formatted for improved readability in Logcat.

---

### File Logging

Probe writes logs using append mode.
Logs persist across app restarts unless the file is manually cleared.
File logging is recommended for debugging issues that cannot be reproduced locally.

```kotlin
Probe.init(
    logFile = File(applicationContext.filesDir, "probe.txt")
)
```

---

## 🛠 Configuration Example

```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        Probe.init(
            tag = "Probe",
            isLoggingEnabled = BuildConfig.DEBUG,
            logFile = null
        )
    }
}
```

## 🛡️ Logging in Release Builds

For release builds, logging should be disabled for performance and security.

- **Debug builds**: Logging enabled.
- **Release builds**: Logging disabled by setting `isLoggingEnabled = false`.
